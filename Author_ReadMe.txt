The examples for this video all use the standard, World Wide Importers database from Microsoft. You can find the database on GitHub at the following URL:

https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/wide-world-importers 

Be sure to instal both editions of the database. Early examples in the book tend to use the OLTP edition of the database, whereas later examples favor the data warehouse edition. In all cases, you'll find USE statements in the example code that select the proper database edition for the examples at hand.
